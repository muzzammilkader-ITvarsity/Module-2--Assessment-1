    The Zoo Playground is designed for kids to have fun while parents take a
    break. With safe and exciting play structures, slides, and climbing areas,
    it’s a place where children can burn off energy before continuing their zoo
    adventure. The playground is located close to the café, making it a favorite
    spot for families.
